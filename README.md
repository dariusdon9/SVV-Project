I have a problem with MY IDE, it takes in consideration the tests for methods but not the test for the classes, i noted every single test that i have done to be easily to understand that I can test only the methods, but not the lines, I will put a screen shot with my results. 

My coverage for lines are not break 30-40 percent, and it is not a stable one, because at every single compiler usage,  my numbers changing at line covarage.

Also, the majority of my methods are void, void can not be tested, another argument for the lack of the covarage
